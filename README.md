This is my submission repo for the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021.

This application has been developed following the agile methodology using react for the frontend part and nodejs for the backend. 
It has been developed in 3 sprints, each lasting a week.

### Sprint 1
* Design the UI and the most suitable platforms or frameworks for the development.
* Decide the entire workflow of the app, components and overall structure.

### Sprint 2
* Develop the server for signalling using WebRTC.
* Develop the frontend components and combine them to get the video chatting functionality.

### Sprint 3
* Add the chat feature, and make it accessible independent of the meeting.
* Make minor UI improvments and thoroughly test all the features with different numbers of users in a room.

## List of Features
* Turn Microphone On/Off.
* Turn Camera On/Off.
* Conduct multiple meetings at the same time with each meeting having upto 5 people.
* in meeting chat.
* Access meeting chat before or after the meeting.
* Invite button to diectly copy joining info to the clipboard.
* Secure and fast, does not involve any intermediate server, direct peer to peer connections.


Keeping in mind the agile methodology, the application has been developed such that switching to an Communication SDK 
in future can be done easily without introducing a lot ofmajor changes in the codebase.

The application has been tested thoroughly with upto 5 people and performed with the same smoothness irrespective of the number of users.

Following is a short demo of its functionality and its currently deployed at the url provided so that you can test it out yourselves.
